## My Thoughts
I had a lot of fun building this project from scratch, while also learning various new things, such as how to implement a carousel item slider 
and an overlay when opening and closing the shopping cart. This was also a good opportunity for me to practice React routing as well as use less 
popular React hooks that I did not have the chance to try out before.
